- The best defence in this case is to disable LLMNR and NBT-NS.
	- To disable LLMNR, select "Turn OFF Multicast Name Resolution" under Local Computer Policy > Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Network > DNS Client in the Group Policy Editor.
	- To disable NBT-NS, navigate to Network Connections > Network Adaptor Properties > TCP/IPv4 Properties > Advanced tab > WINS tab > and select "Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP".
- If a company must use or cannot disable LLMNR/NBT-NS, the best course of action is to:
	- Require Network Access Control.
	- Require strong user passwords (>14 characters, and limit common word usage). The more complex and long the password, the harder it is for an attacker to crack the hash.
